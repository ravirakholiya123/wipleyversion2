I am uploading a ZIP folder that contains my complete ReactJS project for Wipely, a cleaning service provider website in Australia.
The ZIP includes all files and resources except node_modules.

Please convert this entire project into Next.js 14 (App Router) with better SEO, while keeping the design and functionality exactly the same.
